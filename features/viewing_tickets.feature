Feature: Viewing tickets
	In order to view the tickets for a project
	As a user
	I want to see them on that project's page
	

	Background:
		Given there are the following users:
			| email						| password 	|
			| dheeraj@mobiporter.com	| password 	|
		And I am signed in as them		
		And there is a project called "TextMate 2"
		And "dheeraj@mobiporter.com" can view the "TextMate 2" project
		And "dheeraj@mobiporter.com" has created a ticket for this project:
			| title				| description 					|
			| Make it shiny!	| Gradients!  Starbusts! Oh my! |
		And there is a project called "Internet Explorer"
		And "dheeraj@mobiporter.com" can view the "Internet Explorer" project
		And "dheeraj@mobiporter.com" has created a ticket for this project:
			| title					| description 	|
			| Standards compliance	| Isn't a joke.	|
		And I am on the homepage

	Scenario: Viewing tickets for a given project
		When I follow "TextMate 2"
		Then I should see "Make it shiny!"
		And I should not see "Standards compliance"
		When I follow "Make it shiny!"
		Then I should see "Make it shiny!" within "#ticket h2"
		And I should see "Gradients! Starbusts! Oh my!"
		
		When I follow "Ticketee"
		And I follow "Internet Explorer"
		Then I should see "Standards compliance"
		And I should not see "Make it shiny!"
		When I follow "Standards compliance"
		Then I should see "Standards compliance" within "#ticket h2"
		And I should see "Isn't a joke."
